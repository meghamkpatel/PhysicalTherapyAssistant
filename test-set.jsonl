{"id":"ce7b9315-c6b9-49e0-8f38-c6617ebb6751","question":"What is the recommended approach to return to sports following a sports-related concussion?","reference_answer":"The recommended approach to return to sports following a sports-related concussion is a time-based and criterion-based rehabilitation protocol. This protocol includes phases from early post-injury (0-3 days) to full return to sport (months after surgery). The protocol involves gradually reintroducing activity, avoiding contact, and progressing through rehab stages as the patient's symptoms improve. Specific interventions should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. A multidisciplinary team should approach the decision to return to sport, and if a patient is not progressing as expected, they should be referred to a concussion specialty clinic.","reference_context":"Document 0: Rehabilitation Protocol for Concussion Return-to-Sport  This protocol is intended to guide clinicians through the return to sport following sports-related concussion. This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on physician preference, healing timeline and sporting activity. Return to sport following concussion can be a complex decision-making process and should be approached with a multidisciplinary team approach. If a patient is not progressing as expected, they should quickly be referred to a concussion specialty clinic.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for concussion return to sport Current literature no longer supports a period of complete rest beyond 72 hours. Concussion recovery should be focused around active rehabilitation. Activities should be performed at a sub-symptom threshold to the patient\u2019s tolerance. A patient should undergo formal exertional testing and a graded exercise protocol should be based on max exercise tolerance. If a clinician is not familiar with this testing and exercise prescription, the patient should be referred to a specialist.  PHASE I: EARLY POST-INJURY (0-3 DAYS) Rehabilitation Goals \u2022 Relative rest Precautions \u2022 Throughout progression, there should be minimal symptoms. If symptoms are  starting, rest see if symptoms resolve and the resume at a slightly lower heart rate with goal of not increasing symptoms for pre-exercise level Intervention \u2022 Household and community activities as tolerated Criteria to Progress \u2022 3 days post injury  PHASE II: INTERMEDIATE POST-INJURY Rehabilitation Goals \u2022 Gradually reintroduce aerobic activity \u2022 Decrease deconditioning Precautions \u2022 Limit head movement, distractions and maintain neutral neck position \u2022 Avoid Valsalva \u2022 No contact Additional Intervention *Continue with Phase I interventions \u2022 Light activity to gradually increase heart rate. If symptoms do not increase next session can increase workload slightly more \u2022 Exercise examples: \u2022 Light biking \u2022 Walking Criteria to Progress \u2022 Tolerating activity well without symptoms, progress through gradually until able to achieve 85% of age adjust heart rate without symptoms \u2022 Able to tolerate daily activities without significant increase in visual\/vestibular symptoms  PHASE III: LATE POST-INJURY Rehabilitation Goals \u2022 Reintroduce movement \u2022 Progress active rehab Precautions \u2022 Avoid Valsalva \u2022 No contact Additional Intervention *Continue with Phase I-II Interventions \u2022 Increased head movement with activity \u2022 Running, skating, swimming, rowing, shooting on empty goal, foot work, stick work \u2022 Increased environmental distractions \u2022 Busy gym, running with people around \u2022 Increased cognitive demands \u2022 Doing math in head, talking, thinking through plays while exercising Criteria to Progress \u2022 No symptoms with above exercise \u2022 Minimal to no symptoms with all activities including daily activities, school, work etc.  PHASE IV: TRANSITIONAL Rehabilitation Goals Reintroduce sport specific activity, while continuing to avoid contact Additional Intervention *Continue with Phase I-III interventions Sport specific activity Passing drills, shooting drills, non-contact drill participation Criteria to Progress No symptoms with above activity  PHASE V: FULL RETURN TO SPORT ( MONTHS AFTER SURGERY) Rehabilitation Goals Full return to sport Additional Intervention *Continue with Phase II-IV interventions Scrimmage play first, then full game play if asymptomatic Revised 9\/2021  Contact Please email MGHSportsPhysicalTherapy@partners.org with questions specific to this protocol References:  1.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative SLAP repair Rehabilitation Program Many different factors influence the post-operative SLAP repair rehabilitation outcome, including the type of SLAP lesion, the size of the tear\/number of anchors placed, concomitant procedures and amount of shoulder hypermobility and\/or hyperlaxity. Consider mechanism of injury as well as the sport the athlete would like to return to when initiating certain interventions.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative sternoclavicular joint reconstruction Many different factors influence the post-operative rehabilitation outcome, including surgical technique (ie. tendon autograft harvest for repair), degree of SC joint instability, concomitant soft tissue or bone injury\/repair, and individual patient factors including co-morbidities. It is recommended that patients meet all rehabilitation criteria in order to progress to the next phase and clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician throughout the rehabilitation process.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative Many different factors influence the post-operative UCL reconstruction rehabilitation outcomes, including whether a palmaris longus or gracilis graft was performed and individual co-morbidities. It is recommended that clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician.  If you develop a fever, excessive drainage from incision, severe heat and\/or redness along incision, uncontrolled pain, or any other symptoms that concern you please call your doctor.

It is time-based and criterion-based, with interventions being specific to the needs of the individual. The protocol is divided into different phases. Phase I (0-6 weeks after surgery) focuses on reducing pain and swelling, maintaining elbow, wrist and hand AROM, and patient education. Phase II (6-12 weeks after surgery) aims to activate muscles responsible for stabilizing the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joint, restore PROM and AAROM of the GH joint, and begin shoulder and scapular strengthening. Phase III (13+ weeks after surgery) focuses on restoring full rotator cuff strength at 90 degrees abduction including supraspinatus, full multi-planar AROM, and advancing proprioceptive and dynamic neuromuscular control training. The protocol recommends close collaboration with the referring physician throughout the rehabilitation process.","reference_context":"Document 3: Rehabilitation Protocol for SLAP Repair-Type II  This protocol is intended to guide clinicians through the post-operative course for SLAP Repair-Type II.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative SLAP repair Rehabilitation Program Many different factors influence the post-operative SLAP repair rehabilitation outcome, including the type of SLAP lesion, the size of the tear\/number of anchors placed, concomitant procedures and amount of shoulder hypermobility and\/or hyperlaxity. Consider mechanism of injury as well as the sport the athlete would like to return to when initiating certain interventions.  Post-operative Complications If you develop a fever, unresolving numbness\/tingling, excessive drainage from the incision, uncontrolled pain or any other symptoms you have concerns about you should contact the referring physician.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative sternoclavicular joint reconstruction Many different factors influence the post-operative rehabilitation outcome, including surgical technique (ie. tendon autograft harvest for repair), degree of SC joint instability, concomitant soft tissue or bone injury\/repair, and individual patient factors including co-morbidities. It is recommended that patients meet all rehabilitation criteria in order to progress to the next phase and clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician throughout the rehabilitation process.
