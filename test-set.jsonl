This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative Many different factors influence the post-operative UCL reconstruction rehabilitation outcomes, including whether a palmaris longus or gracilis graft was performed and individual co-morbidities. It is recommended that clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician.  If you develop a fever, excessive drainage from incision, severe heat and\/or redness along incision, uncontrolled pain, or any other symptoms that concern you please call your doctor.

Progression is both criteria based and patient specific. Phases and time frames are designed to give the clinician and therapist a general sense of progression. The rehabilitation program following rotator cuff repair must take into account and allow for the healing of surgically repaired tissue. The patient should NOT have pain with these exercises. The program should balance the aspects of tissue healing and appropriate interventions to restore ROM, strength, and function. Factors that influence the rate at which a patient can be progressed through the program include surgical technique, quality of the tissue repaired, size of the tear, timing of the repair, etiology of the tear, and the location of tear.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative SLAP repair Rehabilitation Program Many different factors influence the post-operative SLAP repair rehabilitation outcome, including the type of SLAP lesion, the size of the tear\/number of anchors placed, concomitant procedures and amount of shoulder hypermobility and\/or hyperlaxity. Consider mechanism of injury as well as the sport the athlete would like to return to when initiating certain interventions.  Post-operative Complications If you develop a fever, unresolving numbness\/tingling, excessive drainage from the incision, uncontrolled pain or any other symptoms you have concerns about you should contact the referring physician.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative sternoclavicular joint reconstruction Many different factors influence the post-operative rehabilitation outcome, including surgical technique (ie. tendon autograft harvest for repair), degree of SC joint instability, concomitant soft tissue or bone injury\/repair, and individual patient factors including co-morbidities. It is recommended that patients meet all rehabilitation criteria in order to progress to the next phase and clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician throughout the rehabilitation process.  Post-operative Complications If you develop a fever, unresolving numbness\/tingling, excessive drainage from the incision, uncontrolled pain or any other symptoms you have concerns about you should contact the referring physician.

Progression is both criteria based and patient specific. Phases and time frames are designed to give the clinician and therapist a general sense of progression. The rehabilitation program following rotator cuff repair must take into account and allow for the healing of surgically repaired tissue. The patient should NOT have pain with these exercises. The program should balance the aspects of tissue healing and appropriate interventions to restore ROM, strength, and function. Factors that influence the rate at which a patient can be progressed through the program include surgical technique, quality of the tissue repaired, size of the tear, timing of the repair, etiology of the tear, and the location of tear. All of these factors may alter the guideline.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative sternoclavicular joint reconstruction Many different factors influence the post-operative rehabilitation outcome, including surgical technique (ie. tendon autograft harvest for repair), degree of SC joint instability, concomitant soft tissue or bone injury\/repair, and individual patient factors including co-morbidities. It is recommended that patients meet all rehabilitation criteria in order to progress to the next phase and clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician throughout the rehabilitation process.

Progression is both criteria based and patient specific. Phases and time frames are designed to give the clinician and therapist a general sense of progression. The rehabilitation program following rotator cuff repair must take into account and allow for the healing of surgically repaired tissue. The patient should NOT have pain with these exercises. The program should balance the aspects of tissue healing and appropriate interventions to restore ROM, strength, and function. Factors that influence the rate at which a patient can be progressed through the program include surgical technique, quality of the tissue repaired, size of the tear, timing of the repair, etiology of the tear, and the location of tear.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative sternoclavicular joint reconstruction Many different factors influence the post-operative rehabilitation outcome, including surgical technique (ie. tendon autograft harvest for repair), degree of SC joint instability, concomitant soft tissue or bone injury\/repair, and individual patient factors including co-morbidities. It is recommended that patients meet all rehabilitation criteria in order to progress to the next phase and clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician throughout the rehabilitation process.  Post-operative Complications If you develop a fever, unresolving numbness\/tingling, excessive drainage from the incision, uncontrolled pain or any other symptoms you have concerns about you should contact the referring physician.

Progression is both criteria based and patient specific. Phases and time frames are designed to give the clinician and therapist a general sense of progression. The rehabilitation program following rotator cuff repair must take into account and allow for the healing of surgically repaired tissue. The patient should NOT have pain with these exercises. The program should balance the aspects of tissue healing and appropriate interventions to restore ROM, strength, and function. Factors that influence the rate at which a patient can be progressed through the program include surgical technique, quality of the tissue repaired, size of the tear, timing of the repair, etiology of the tear, and the location of tear. All of these factors may alter the guideline. Please call and notify Dr. Li\u2019s office if you are deviating from these recommendations or if the patient has increased pain or stiffness that is not expected.  ** Weeks 0-3: Patient stays in the sling and abduction pillow at all times.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative sternoclavicular joint reconstruction Many different factors influence the post-operative rehabilitation outcome, including surgical technique (ie. tendon autograft harvest for repair), degree of SC joint instability, concomitant soft tissue or bone injury\/repair, and individual patient factors including co-morbidities. It is recommended that patients meet all rehabilitation criteria in order to progress to the next phase and clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician throughout the rehabilitation process.

Progression is both criteria based and patient specific. Phases and time frames are designed to give the clinician and therapist a general sense of progression. The rehabilitation program following rotator cuff repair must take into account and allow for the healing of surgically repaired tissue. The patient should NOT have pain with these exercises. The program should balance the aspects of tissue healing and appropriate interventions to restore ROM, strength, and function. Factors that influence the rate at which a patient can be progressed through the program include surgical technique, quality of the tissue repaired, size of the tear, timing of the repair, etiology of the tear, and the location of tear. All of these factors may alter the guideline.

Progression is both criteria based and patient specific. Phases and time frames are designed to give the clinician and therapist a general sense of progression. The rehabilitation program following rotator cuff repair must take into account and allow for the healing of surgically repaired tissue. The patient should NOT have pain with these exercises. The program should balance the aspects of tissue healing and appropriate interventions to restore ROM, strength, and function. Factors that influence the rate at which a patient can be progressed through the program include surgical technique, quality of the tissue repaired, size of the tear, timing of the repair, etiology of the tear, and the location of tear. All of these factors may alter the guideline.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative sternoclavicular joint reconstruction Many different factors influence the post-operative rehabilitation outcome, including surgical technique (ie. tendon autograft harvest for repair), degree of SC joint instability, concomitant soft tissue or bone injury\/repair, and individual patient factors including co-morbidities. It is recommended that patients meet all rehabilitation criteria in order to progress to the next phase and clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician throughout the rehabilitation process.  Post-operative Complications If you develop a fever, unresolving numbness\/tingling, excessive drainage from the incision, uncontrolled pain or any other symptoms you have concerns about you should contact the referring physician.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative sternoclavicular joint reconstruction Many different factors influence the post-operative rehabilitation outcome, including surgical technique (ie. tendon autograft harvest for repair), degree of SC joint instability, concomitant soft tissue or bone injury\/repair, and individual patient factors including co-morbidities. It is recommended that patients meet all rehabilitation criteria in order to progress to the next phase and clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician throughout the rehabilitation process.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative Many different factors influence the post-operative UCL reconstruction rehabilitation outcomes, including whether a palmaris longus or gracilis graft was performed and individual co-morbidities. It is recommended that clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician.  If you develop a fever, excessive drainage from incision, severe heat and\/or redness along incision, uncontrolled pain, or any other symptoms that concern you please call your doctor.

Progression is both criteria based and patient specific. Phases and time frames are designed to give the clinician and therapist a general sense of progression. The rehabilitation program following rotator cuff repair must take into account and allow for the healing of surgically repaired tissue. The patient should NOT have pain with these exercises. The program should balance the aspects of tissue healing and appropriate interventions to restore ROM, strength, and function. Factors that influence the rate at which a patient can be progressed through the program include surgical technique, quality of the tissue repaired, size of the tear, timing of the repair, etiology of the tear, and the location of tear. All of these factors may alter the guideline. Please call and notify Dr. Li\u2019s office if you are deviating from these recommendations or if the patient has increased pain or stiffness that is not expected.  2  4 WEEKS POST  OP (Maximum Protection Phase):  GOALS: 1.

Progression is both criteria based and patient specific. Phases and time frames are designed to give the clinician and therapist a general sense of progression. The rehabilitation program following rotator cuff repair must take into account and allow for the healing of surgically repaired tissue. The patient should NOT have pain with these exercises. The program should balance the aspects of tissue healing and appropriate interventions to restore ROM, strength, and function. Factors that influence the rate at which a patient can be progressed through the program include surgical technique, quality of the tissue repaired, size of the tear, timing of the repair, etiology of the tear, and the location of tear. All of these factors may alter the guideline. Please call and notify Dr. Li\u2019s office if you are deviating from these recommendations or if the patient has increased pain or stiffness that is not expected.  ** Weeks 0-3: Patient stays in the sling and abduction pillow at all times.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative sternoclavicular joint reconstruction Many different factors influence the post-operative rehabilitation outcome, including surgical technique (ie. tendon autograft harvest for repair), degree of SC joint instability, concomitant soft tissue or bone injury\/repair, and individual patient factors including co-morbidities. It is recommended that patients meet all rehabilitation criteria in order to progress to the next phase and clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician throughout the rehabilitation process.

PMID: 32801951; PMCID: PMC7395708.\n\nDocument 3: Rehabilitation Protocol for SLAP Repair-Type II  This protocol is intended to guide clinicians through the post-operative course for SLAP Repair-Type II. This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative SLAP repair Rehabilitation Program Many different factors influence the post-operative SLAP repair rehabilitation outcome, including the type of SLAP lesion, the size of the tear\/number of anchors placed, concomitant procedures and amount of shoulder hypermobility and\/or hyperlaxity. Consider mechanism of injury as well as the sport the athlete would like to return to when initiating certain interventions.  Post-operative Complications If you develop a fever, unresolving numbness\/tingling, excessive drainage from the incision, uncontrolled pain or any other symptoms you have concerns about you should contact the referring physician.

Progression is both criteria based and patient specific. Phases and time frames are designed to give the clinician and therapist a general sense of progression. The rehabilitation program following rotator cuff repair must take into account and allow for the healing of surgically repaired tissue. The patient should NOT have pain with these exercises. The program should balance the aspects of tissue healing and appropriate interventions to restore ROM, strength, and function. Factors that influence the rate at which a patient can be progressed through the program include surgical technique, quality of the tissue repaired, size of the tear, timing of the repair, etiology of the tear, and the location of tear.

This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon\u2019s preference, additional procedures performed, and\/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative sternoclavicular joint reconstruction Many different factors influence the post-operative rehabilitation outcome, including surgical technique (ie. tendon autograft harvest for repair), degree of SC joint instability, concomitant soft tissue or bone injury\/repair, and individual patient factors including co-morbidities. It is recommended that patients meet all rehabilitation criteria in order to progress to the next phase and clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician throughout the rehabilitation process.  Post-operative Complications If you develop a fever, unresolving numbness\/tingling, excessive drainage from the incision, uncontrolled pain or any other symptoms you have concerns about you should contact the referring physician.

Phase I (Weeks 2-6) involves sling immobilization, passive exercises, and scapular pinches. Phase II (Weeks 6-10) discontinues the sling immobilizer and introduces passive & active assisted exercises, manual scapular side lying stabilization exercises, and humeral head control exercises. Phase III (Weeks 10-16) progresses ROM as tolerated and introduces flexibility exercises, isotonic strengthening, scapular stabilization, rhythmic stabilization, and the use of progressive resistive equipment. Phase IV (Weeks 16-22) addresses any remaining deficits in ROM, flexibility, and strength, and individualizes the program to meet the specific needs of the patient.

Normal scapular mobility 2. Full active ROM distal to shoulder 3. Shoulder ROM to within surgeon\u2019s set ROM goals  6-8 WEEKS POST-OP (Moderate Protection Phase): GOALS: 1. Protect surgical repair (Sling and Abduction Pillow at ALL TIMES) 2. Decrease pain\/ inflammation, minimize rotator cuff inhibition 3. Improve Range of Motion 80-100% of normal elevation in the plane of the scapula and external rotation 4. Improve proximal scapula strength\/stability, scapulohumeral rhythm and neuromuscular control  Continue Pendulums, passive supine elevation, passive ER  Active  Assisted ROM: Scapular plane elevation to 160\u00b0 (NO PAIN) Pulleys as motion improves  Use cane for ER to 60\u00b0 (NO PAIN)  Begin Internal Rotation as tolerated.  Begin Scapular strengthening program, in protective range of motion  Physioball Scapular stabilization (below horizontal)  Isometric exercises: Deltoid isometrics Submaximal ER\/IR isometrics at neutral  Isotonic exercises for Scapular stabilizers  Elbow Modalities as needed  Joint Mobilization by the Therapist  Pool Therapy if available  PRECAUTIONS: 1. Avoid pain with ADLs, ROM\/ therapeutic exercise 2. Avoid active elevation of arm until 6 weeks, avoid exceeding ROM limitations 3. No maximal cuff activation  MINIMUM CRITERIA FOR ADVANCEMENT: 1. Ability to activate cuff and deltoid without pain  3 2. Tolerates arm out of sling (May discontinue the sling at Week #6, Slowly Wane) 3. ROM 80% or greater for elevation in plane of the scapula and external rotation  9-14 WEEKS POST-OP: (Early Strengthening Phase) GOALS: 1. Eliminate\/ minimize pain and inflammation 2. Restore full PROM 3. Gradual return to light ADLs below 90\u00ba elevation 4. Improve strength\/ flexibility 5. Normal scapulohumeral rhythm below 90\u00ba elevation  Patient Should NOT have pain with any of these exercises  AROM elevation in the plane of the scapula (supine progress to standing), progress closed chain exercises  Begin Theraband IR \/ ER at week 7  Use towel to increase IR  ROM activities and emphasize flexion. Gentle passive stretch.  Deltoid isometrics at 30\u00b0 elevation  Deltoid isotonics in plane of Scapula, only after positive Rotator Cuff strength is determined (especially forward flexion)  Continue with Scapular PRE\u2019s.  Biceps PREs  Upper body Ergometer  Continue with modalities, prn.  Restore full ROM by 12 weeks  PRECAUTIONS: 1. Monitor activity level (patient to avoid jerking movements and lifting heavy objects) 2. Limit overhead activity 3. Avoid shoulder \u201cshrug\u201d with activity and AROM\/strengthening exercises  MINIMUM CRITERIA FOR ADVANCEMENT: 1. Minimal pain and\/or inflammation 2. Full PROM 3. Improved rotator cuff and scapula strength 4. Normal scapulohumeral rhythm with shoulder elevation below 90\u00ba  15-23 WEEKS POST-OP: (Late Strengthening Phase) GOALS: 1. Improve strength to 5\/5 for scapula and shoulder musculature 2. Improve neuromuscular control 3. Normalize scapulohumeral rhythm throughout the full ROM  Progress Rotator cuff and Periscapular isotonics  Continue with aggressive Scapular exercises \/ stabilization  Upper extremity PRE\u2019s for large muscle groups, i.e. Pects, Lats, etc.  Begin isokinetic program, IR \/ ER emphasize eccentrics  Continue with flexibility activities (Posterior Cuff and Capsule)  Begin plyometric program for overhead athletes at 15 week. Continue with throwing program  Sports specific strengthening (when PROM and AROM is full)  Posterior capsule stretching after warm  ups  4 - Progress PRE\u2019s from side for overhead athletes  24-26 WEEKS POST-OP: (Return to Sports or Full Activity) GOALS: 1. Maximize flexibility, strength & neuromuscular control to meet demands of sport, return to work, recreational and daily activity 2. Isokinetic testing (If Available) - 85% limb symmetry 3. Independent in home & gym therapeutic exercise programs for maintenance and progression of functional level at discharge  Plyometrics above horizontal if no pain  Continue with isotonics and stabilization for rotator cuff  Continue with strengthening exercises for large upper body muscle groups and periscapular muscles  Continue with the above program and advance per patient progress  PRECAUTIONS: 1. Avoid pain with therapeutic exercises and activity 2. Avoid sport activity until adequate strength, flexibility and neuromuscular control 3. MD clearance needed for sport activity or back to work (heavy laborer) without restrictions  CRITERIA FOR DISCHARGE: 1. Isokinetic testing close to normal ER\/IR ratios (66%), 85% symmetry 2. Independence with home\/gym program at discharge for maintenance and progression of flexibility, strength and neuromuscular control","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"Let's talk about the recommended progression for physical therapy following a total shoulder arthroplasty."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":6,"topic":"Others"}}
