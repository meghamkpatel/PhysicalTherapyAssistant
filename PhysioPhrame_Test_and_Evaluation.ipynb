            "Document 1: Massachusetts General Brigham Sports Medicine  Rehabilitation Guidelines for Ulnar Collateral Ligament Reconstruction (Palmaris Longus Graft, Gracilis Graft)  This protocol is intended to guide clinicians through the post-operative course for Ulnar Collateral Ligament Reconstruction (Palmaris Longus Graft, Gracilis Graft). This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon’s preference, additional procedures performed, and/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon.  The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  Considerations for the Post-operative Many different factors influence the post-operative UCL reconstruction rehabilitation outcomes, including whether a palmaris longus or gracilis graft was performed and individual co-morbidities. It is recommended that clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician.  If you develop a fever, excessive drainage from incision, severe heat and/or redness along incision, uncontrolled pain, or any other symptoms that concern you please call your doctor.

Progression is both criteria based and patient specific. Phases and time frames are designed to give the clinician and therapist a general sense of progression. The rehabilitation program following rotator cuff repair must take into account and allow for the healing of surgically repaired tissue. The patient should NOT have pain with these exercises. The program should balance the aspects of tissue healing and appropriate interventions to restore ROM, strength, and function. Factors that influence the rate at which a patient can be progressed through the program include surgical technique, quality of the tissue repaired, size of the tear, timing of the repair, etiology of the tear, and the location of tear. All of these factors may alter the guideline. Please call and notify Dr. Li’s office if you are deviating from these recommendations or if the patient has increased pain or stiffness that is not expected.  ** Weeks 0-3: Patient stays in the sling and abduction pillow at all times.

Shoulder ROM to within surgeon\\\\u2019s set ROM goals\",\"Return to sport following concussion can be a complex decision-making process and should be approached with a multidisciplinary team approach. The process is time based as well as criterion based, and specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual. The protocol includes various phases, starting with relative rest and gradually reintroducing activity, movement, sport specific activity, and finally full return to sport. According to current literature, concussion recovery should no longer support a period of complete rest beyond 72 hours and should be focused around active rehabilitation. Activities should be performed at a sub-symptom threshold to the patient\\\\u2019s tolerance. A patient should undergo formal exertional testing and a graded exercise protocol should be based on max exercise tolerance.\",\"The general goal of the physical therapy prescription for a reverse shoulder arthroplasty is to gradually increase the range of motion, minimize pain and inflammation, and restore muscle strength and function. The rate at which a patient can progress through the program is influenced by factors such as surgical technique, quality of the tissue repaired, size of the tear, timing of the repair, etiology of the tear, and the location of tear.\",\"The typical visit frequency for the Slow or Conservative Program for rotator cuff physical therapy is 2 to 3 times per week. The goals for the Maximum Protection Phase in the Advanced Program are to protect the surgical repair, decrease pain and inflammation, gradually increase shoulder range of motion, improve proximal and distal strength and mobility, and achieve independence in a home exercise program.\",\"The physical therapy for a total shoulder arthroplasty is divided into four phases, focusing on immobilization, gentle exercises, active exercises, ROM progression, isotonic strengthening, and individualization to the patient&#x27;s needs. The physical therapy for a large rotator cuff repair is divided into phases focusing on protection of the surgical repair, gradual increase in shoulder ROM, decrease in pain and inflammation, improvement in ROM and strength, restoration of full PROM, and improvement in strength and neuromuscular control.\",\"The main goals of the physical therapy prescription after a rotator cuff repair are to protect the surgical repair, decrease pain and inflammation, gradually increase shoulder range of motion, improve proximal and distal strength and mobility, and achieve independence in a home exercise program. The criteria for advancing to the next phase in the physical therapy prescription for a total shoulder arthroplasty include: minimal pain and inflammation with motion and exercise, incision is well healed with no drainage and no redness, and achieving the set range of motion goals.\",\"The goals of the first 4 weeks post-operation for an Advanced Program for rotator cuff physical therapy are to protect the surgical repair, decrease pain and inflammation, gradually increase shoulder range of motion as directed by the doctor, improve proximal and distal strength and mobility, and achieve independence in a home exercise program. The advancement criteria for the phase III of the total shoulder arthroplasty physical therapy prescription are muscle strength of 4/5, passive forward flexion of 160 degrees, external rotation greater than 45 degrees, restoration of normal scapulohumeral rhythm below 90 degree elevation, and minimal pain and inflammation.\",\"Many different factors influence the post-operative rehabilitation outcome, including surgical approach, concomitant repair of the rotator cuff, arthroplasty secondary to fracture, arthroplasty secondary to rheumatoid arthritis or osteonecrosis, and individual patient factors including co-morbidities.\",\"Some of the factors that influence the post-operative SLAP repair rehabilitation outcome include the type of SLAP lesion, the size of the tear/number of anchors placed, concomitant procedures and amount of shoulder hypermobility and/or hyperlaxity. Consideration of the mechanism of injury as well as the sport the athlete would like to return to when initiating certain interventions is also important.\",\"The recommended frequency of visits per week for the physical therapy programs is 2 to 3 times.\",\"The rehabilitation goals for Phase I of the Sternoclavicular Joint Reconstruction protocol are to reduce pain and swelling of the operative shoulder, maintain elbow, wrist and hand AROM, and provide patient education.\",\"The goals of the &#x27;Early Strengthening Phase&#x27; are: 1. Eliminate/ minimize pain and inflammation, 2. Restore full passive range of motion, 3. Gradual return to light activities of daily living below 90\\\\u00ba elevation, 4. Improve strength/ flexibility, 5. Normal scapulohumeral rhythm below 90\\\\u00ba elevation.\",\"The progression for physical therapy following a total shoulder arthroplasty is divided into four phases. Phase I (Weeks 2-6) involves sling immobilization, passive exercises, and scapular pinches. Phase II (Weeks 6-10) discontinues the sling immobilizer and introduces passive &amp; active assisted exercises, manual scapular side lying stabilization exercises, and humeral head control exercises. Phase III (Weeks 10-16) progresses ROM as tolerated and introduces flexibility exercises, isotonic strengthening, scapular stabilization, rhythmic stabilization, and the use of progressive resistive equipment. Phase IV (Weeks 16-22) addresses any remaining deficits in ROM, flexibility, and strength, and individualizes the program to meet the specific needs of the patient. The discharge criteria include maximizing ROM, achieving full independent ADLs, and normal scapulohumeral rhythm.\"]],[\"id\",[7,1,2,3,7,7,6,7,4,6,4,2,6,4,7,3,0,5,8,1,3,4,1,8,4,0,0,7,0,8,2,6,2,7,3,5,8,4,8,6]],[\"content\",[\"Visit per week:  2 to 3 times  ROTATOR CUFF PHYSICAL THERAPY PRESCRIPTION (Advanced Program)  The following rotator cuff repair guidelines were developed by Dr. Xinning Li, which is based on the postoperative rehabilitation recommendations from the Hospital for Special Surgery.
