 
 
Rehabilitation Protocol for Total Shoulder Arthroplasty and 
Hemiarthroplasty 
 
This protocol is intended to guide clinicians and patients through the post-operative course after a total shoulder 
arthroplasty (TSA) and hemiarthroplasty. Specific interventions should be based on the needs of the individual and 
should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. If you have questions, contact the referring physician.  
 
Considerations for the Total Shoulder Arthroplasty and Hemiarthroplasty Rehabilitation Program 
Many different factors influence the post-operative rehabilitation outcome, including surgical approach, concomitant 
repair of the rotator cuff, arthroplasty secondary to fracture, arthroplasty secondary to rheumatoid arthritis or 
osteonecrosis, and individual patient factors including co-morbidities. It is recommended that patients meet all 
rehabilitation criteria in order to progress to the next phase and clinicians collaborate closely with the referring 
physician throughout the rehabilitation process.  
 
Post-operative Complications 
If you develop a fever, unresolving numbness/tingling, excessive drainage from the incision, uncontrolled pain or any 
other symptoms you have concerns about you should contact the referring physician.
