 
 
Rehabilitation Protocol for Distal Biceps Tendon Repair 
 
This protocol is intended to guide clinicians through the post-operative course for distal biceps tendon repair. This 
protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on 
the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected 
outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon’s preference, additional procedures performed, 
and/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult 
with the referring surgeon. 
The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic 
interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the 
clinician.  
Considerations for the Post-operative Distal Biceps Tendon Repair 
Many different factors influence the post-operative distal biceps tendon repair rehabilitation outcomes, including post-
operative pain and edema as well as specific suture material chose by surgeon. It is recommended that clinicians 
collaborate closely with the referring physician regarding type of repair and precautions with range of motion and lifting 
restrictions. 
 
If you develop a fever, unresolving numbness/tingling, excessive drainage from the incision, uncontrolled pain or any 
other symptoms you have concerns with, please contact referring physician.  
 
 
PHASE I: IMMEDIATE POST-OP (Day 0-1 WEEK AFTER SURGERY) 
Rehabilitation 
Goals 
• Reduce post-operative pain

in 0 degrees of pronation/supination for 5-7 days (unless otherwise indicated by surgeon) 
• Hinged elbow brace: with brace set locked from 90 degrees of flexion to full flexion, initiate 
elbow flexion and forearm pronation/supination passive range of motion (PROM) at 5-7 days 
post-operative 
 
Interventions 
• Modalities to reduce post-operative edema and pain control 
• Grip strengthening with forearm/wrist in neutral position 
• Scar massage 
 
Criteria to 
Progress 
• Adequate maintenance of post-operative pain and edema control 
• Progression of elbow passive range of PROM in elbow flexion and forearm pronation/supination 
within confines of hinged elbow orthosis is based upon referring surgeon’s assessment of 
surgical repair.
