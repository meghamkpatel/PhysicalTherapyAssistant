 
Rehabilitation Protocol for Arthroscopic Partial Meniscectomy 
 
This protocol is intended to guide clinicians through the post-operative course for Arthroscopy Partial Meniscectomy. 
This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be 
based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for 
expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon’s preference, additional procedures 
performed, and/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they 
should consult with the referring surgeon. 
 
The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list. Therapeutic interventions should 
be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  
 
Post-operative considerations 
Post-operative considerations If you develop a fever, intense calf pain, excessive drainage from the incision, 
uncontrolled pain or any other symptoms you have concerns about you should call your doctor. 
 
PHASE I: IMMEDIATE POST-OP (Day 0-7 AFTER SURGERY) 
Rehabilitation 
Goals 
• Reduce swelling, minimize pain 
• Restore knee range of motion (ROM) 
• Re-establish quadriceps activation 
• Patient Education: 
- Keep your knee straight and elevated when sitting or laying down. Do not rest with a 
towel placed under the knee 
- Avoid painful activities 
- Limit excessive walking 
Weight Bearing 
Walking 
• Weight bearing as tolerated with crutches 
• Weaning from crutches may occur in the first several days depending on appropriate resolution 
of edema, achievement of excellent quad activation (evidenced by ability to perform SLR), and 
proper gait pattern under the guidance of the physical therapist  
• When climbing stairs, lead with non-surgical limb and when going down the stairs, lead with the 
surgical limb 
Interventions 
Swelling Management

Strengthening 
• Calf raises 
• Quad sets 
• Hip abduction 
• Straight leg raise

•  Include NMES as needed: NMES high intensity (2500 Hz, 75 bursts) supine knee extended 10 
sec/50 sec, 10 contractions, 2x/week during sessions—use of clinical stimulator during session, 
consider home units distributed immediate post op, can also include functionally into above

• Symmetrical, non-antalgic gait pattern without assistive device 
 
PHASE III: LATE POST-OP (2-8 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY) 
Rehabilitation 
Goals 
• Maintain full and pain free knee ROM 
• Enhance muscle strength and endurance 
• Avoid post exercise pain/swelling 
• Promote proper movement patterns  
Weight Bearing 
FWB 
Additional 
Intervention 
*Continue with 
Phase I-II 
Interventions  
Range of motion/Mobility 
• Patella mobilizations: superior/inferior and medial/lateral 
• Stretching of all muscle groups: prone quad stretch, standing quad stretch, standing hip flexor 
stretch 
• Stationary Bicycle 
 
Cardio  
• 4-6 weeks, as tolerated: Elliptical, stair climber, flutter kick swimming, pool jogging 
 
Strengthening 
• Gym Machine usage: Leg press, seated hamstring curl machine, hip abductor and adductor 
machine, and seated calf machine 
 
 
• Progress intensity (strength) and duration (endurance) of exercises  
 
**The following exercises to focus on proper control with emphasis on good proximal stability  
• Lateral step down 
• Squat to chair  
• Lateral lunges  
• Romanian deadlift and Single leg deadlift 
• Single leg progression: partial weight bearing single leg press, slide board 
lunges: retro and lateral, step ups and step ups with march, split squats, lateral step-ups, step 
downs, single leg squats, single leg wall slides  
 
Balance/proprioception 
• Progress single limb balance including perturbation training 
• Lower quarter reaches (Y-Balance and Star drill) 
 
**When Quadriceps index > 80% strength: 
• Interval running program  
- Return to Running Program  
• Progress to plyometric and agility program 
- Agility and Plyometric Program  
 
Criteria to 
Progress  
• No swelling/pain after exercise 
• Ability to perform ADLs pain free 
 
**If patient is returning to impact activities:
