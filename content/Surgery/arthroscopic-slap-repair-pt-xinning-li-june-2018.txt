  FF in scapular plane to 90 
  Minimal pain and inflammation 
 
Weeks 6-10: Phase II 
 
Sling Immobilizer: Discontinue at week 6 
 
        
Exercises:  
Active assisted FF in scapular plane to 145 (wand exercises, pulleys)  
 
 
Active assisted ER to 30 degrees until week 8 then advance as tolerated 
    
 
Manual scapular side-lying stabilization exercises 
 
 
IR/ER/FF submaximal, pain free isometrics 
 
 
IR/ER/FF isotonic strengthening at 8 weeks 
 
 
Begin humeral head stabilization exercises 
 
2 
 
 
Begin latissumus strengthening: limited to 90 deg FF 
 
 
Modalities as needed 
 
Advancement Criteria: FF to 145 
 
 
 
 ER to 60 
 
 
 
 Normal scapulohumeral rhythm 
 
 
             IR/ER strength 5/5 
 
 
 
 Minimal pain and inflammation 
 
Weeks 10-14: Phase III 
 
Exercises:  
 AAROM for full FF and ER 
 
     
AAROM for IR – no limits 
 
 
Aggressive scapular (esp mid and lower trapezius) and latissimus strengthening  
 
Cont RTC strengthening 
 
 
Begin biceps strengthing 
 
 
Progress IR/ER to 90/90 position if required 
 
 
Isokinetic training and testing 
 
 
General upper extremity flexibility exercises 
 
 
Advancement Criteria: Normal scapulohumeral rhythm 
 Full upper extremity ROM 
 Isokinetic IR/ER strength 85% of uninvolved side 
             Minimal pain and inflamation   
 
Weeks 14-18: Phase IV 
 
Exercises:  
Continue full upper extremity strengthening program 
 
 
Continue upper extremity flexibility exercises  
 
 
Activity-specific plyometrics program 
Begin sport or activity related program  
Address trunk and lower extremity demands 
 
Begin Throwing program 
• Begin light tennis ball tossing at 20-30ft. max at 60% velocity, work on 
mechanics of wind up, early cocking phase, late cocking phase, acceleration, and 
follow through 
• Isokinetics at high speeds – with throwing wand if thrower, 240, 270, 300, 330, 
360°/sec and up, 15 reps each speed  
• Throwers begin re-entry throwing program on level surface (criteria to start 
program listed on re-entry throwing protocol) 
• Continue strengthening and stretching programs 
§ Emphasize posterior capsule stretching  
 
Note – A tight posterior-inferior capsule may initiate the pathologic cascade to a SLAP 
lesion, and that recurrence of the tightness can be expected to place the repair at risk in a 
throwing athlete.

Discharge Criteria:  
 
Isokinetic IR/ER strength equal to uninvolved extremity 
Independent HEP 
Independent, pain-free sport or activity specific program
