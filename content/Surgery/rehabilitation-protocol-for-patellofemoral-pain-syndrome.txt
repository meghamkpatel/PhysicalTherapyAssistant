Rehabilitation Protocol for Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome 
This guideline is intended to provide the clinician with a guideline of the non-operative course of care for Patellofemoral 
Pain Syndrome. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings 
and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary. If a 
clinician requires assistance in the progression of a patient, they should consult with the referring provider.   
 
The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list. Therapeutic interventions should 
be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the clinician.  
 
Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) is a general category of anterior knee pain that is characterized as pain behind or 
around the patella, as a result of patella malalignment, altered patellofemoral (PF) joint forces and/or repetitive stress 
to the area.  Also known as Runner’s Knee, chondromalacia patella, retropatellar pain syndrome, anterior knee pain 
syndrome, patellar malalignment, and patellofemoral arthralgia.  Patellofemoral syndrome can have a collection of signs 
and symptoms which may encompass body regions throughout the kinetic chain, from the lumbar spine to the feet.  
 
Diagnosis 
Considerations 
• Pain: typically reported anywhere circumferential to the anterior knee or retropatellar region. 
• Common Aggravating Factors: prolonged sitting, squatting, climbing/descending stairs, running, 
and jumping. 
• Increased tibiofemoral varum/valgum or tibial varum: normal subjects with hypermobility 
exhibit larger Q angles than normal subjects with normal mobility.  Patients with greater 
amounts of medial rotation of the femur with respect to the tibia, typically produce larger 
amounts of contact area at the patellofemoral joint.   
• Foot position/footwear. Excessive or late pronation during gait can increase tibial internal 
rotation, thus altering patellofemoral forces. 
• Higher-level activities which include landing with excessive hip internal rotation and/or knee 
valgus may contribute to abnormal PF joint loading. 
• Strength deficits (including balance and eccentric control) may be noticeable throughout the 
lower extremity and lumbopelvic region. 
• Special tests: Vastus Medialis Coordination Test, Patellar Apprehension Test, Clarke’s Test, 
Eccentric Step Test, McConnell’s Test, Patellar Tilt Test, Tibial Angulation Test

PHASE I: IMMEDIATE/ACUTE (0-2 WEEKS) 
Rehabilitation 
Goals 
• Reduce any swelling, minimize pain 
• Restore patellar, lower extremity mobility (including hip and ankle) 
• Restore tolerance to full motion

sitting, running, jumping 
- Initial self-symptom management and joint protection 
- Independent with initial home exercise program 
Interventions 
During this early phase, numerous manual interventions may be utilized to reduce the patient’s pain, 
restriction to movement, and joint loading: 
• Soft Tissue Mobilization/Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization 
• Patellar Taping (McConnell, Kinesiotaping) 
• Ischemic compression/Bloodflow Restrictive Training
