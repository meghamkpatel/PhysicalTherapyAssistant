Rehabilitation Guidelines for Ulnar Collateral Ligament 
Reconstruction (Palmaris Longus Graft, Gracilis Graft)  
 
This protocol is intended to guide clinicians through the post-operative course for Ulnar Collateral Ligament 
Reconstruction (Palmaris Longus Graft, Gracilis Graft). This protocol is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well 
as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam 
findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected outcomes contained within this guideline may vary 
based on surgeon’s preference, additional procedures performed, and/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance 
in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon. 
 
The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic 
interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the 
clinician.  
 
Considerations for the Post-operative  
Many different factors influence the post-operative UCL reconstruction rehabilitation outcomes, including whether a 
palmaris longus or gracilis graft was performed and individual co-morbidities. It is recommended that clinicians 
collaborate closely with the referring physician. 
 
If you develop a fever, excessive drainage from incision, severe heat and/or redness along incision, uncontrolled pain, or 
any other symptoms that concern you please call your doctor.
