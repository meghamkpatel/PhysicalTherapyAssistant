Rehabilitation Protocol for Peroneal Tendon Repair 
  
This protocol is intended to guide clinicians through the post-operative course for peroneal tendon repair. This protocol 
is time based (dependent on tissue healing) as well as criterion based. Specific intervention should be based on the 
needs of the individual and should consider exam findings and clinical decision making. The timeframes for expected 
outcomes contained within this guideline may vary based on surgeon’s preference, additional procedures performed, 
and/or complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult 
with the referring surgeon. 
  
The interventions included within this protocol are not intended to be an inclusive list of exercises. Therapeutic 
interventions should be included and modified based on the progress of the patient and under the discretion of the 
clinician.  
  
Considerations for the Post-operative Peroneal Tendon Repair 
Many different factors influence the post-operative peroneal tendon rehabilitation outcomes, including the nature of 
the pathology as well as the surgical approach (tendoscopic or open) and whether the superior peroneal retinaculum 
(SPR) is repaired. It is recommended that clinicians collaborate closely with the referring physician regarding the nature 
of the repair along with specific guidance related to timing of weight bearing, immobilization and the need for 
precautions for inversion and eversion in the early phases of rehabilitation. 
 
If you develop a fever, intense calf pain, uncontrolled pain or any other symptoms you have concerns about you should 
call your doctor. 
 
PHASE I: IMMEDIATE POST-OP (0-2 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY) 
Rehabilitation 
Goals 
• Protect repair. 
• Maintain strength of hip, knee and core. 
• Manage swelling with elevation “toes above nose.” 
• Gait training and safety (emphasize precautions with weight bearing). 
Weight Bearing 
Walking 
• Non weight bearing (NWB) on crutches in splint/cast 
Intervention 
Range of motion/Mobility (in boot/splint) 
• Supine passive hamstring stretch 
 
Strengthening (in boot/splint) 
• Quad sets 
• Straight leg raise 
• Abdominal bracing 
• Hip abduction  
• Sidelying hip external rotation-clamshell 
• Prone hip extension

Criteria to 
Progress 
• Decreased pain and edema 
 
 
 
PHASE II: INTERMEDIATE POST-OP (2-4 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY) 
Rehabilitation 
Goals 
• Continue to protect repair. 
• Reduce pain, minimize swelling. 
• Improve scar mobility once incision is healed. 
• Initiate ankle range of motion with good understanding of restricted planes if applicable. 
• Good tolerance with addition of partial progressive weight bearing. 
Weight Bearing 
Walking  
• Begin partial progressive weight-bearing on crutches in boot/cast with crutches once cleared 
by surgeon.  ***Gradually increase the amount of weight-bearing allowed each week.   This may be 
in percentage of body weight or pounds (per surgeon). 
Additional 
Intervention 
*Continue with 
Phase I 
interventions 
Range of motion/Mobility 
• If the SPR is NOT REPAIRED, initiate ankle passive range of motion (PROM), active assisted 
range of motion (AAROM) and active range of motion (AROM). 
- Ankle pumps 
- Ankle circles 
- Ankle inversion 
- Ankle eversion 
- Seated heel-slides for ankle DF ROM  
• If the SPR is REPAIRED begin ankle ROM as above except NO INVERSION/EVERSION UNTIL 6 
WEEKS POST-OP 
• If stiff from boot initiate great toe DF and PF stretching (by patient or by therapist) 
• May begin gentle scar mobilization once incision is healed.   
 
Cardio 
• Upper body ergometer 
 
Strengthening: 
• Seated heel raises 
• Seated toe raises 
• Exercises for foot intrinsic muscles to minimize atrophy while in boot 
 
Proprioception 
• Joint position re-training 
Criteria to 
Progress 
• Pain < 3/10 
• Minimal swelling (recommend water displacement volumetry or circumference measures such 
as Figure 8). 
• Improved ROM of the ankle (excluding inversion and eversion if SPR is repaired). 
• Good tolerance with weight bearing in boot. 
 
 
 
PHASE III: LATE POST-OP (4-8 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY) 
Rehabilitation 
Goals 
• Continue to protect repair. 
• Restore full range of motion of the ankle 
• Safely progress strengthening. 
• Promote proper movement patterns. 
• Avoid post exercise pain/swelling. 
• FWB in boot without crutches, with good tolerance and normalized gait pattern by week 8. 
Weight Bearing 
Walking 
• If SPR is NOT REPAIRED, may progress from partial progressive weight bearing with crutches 
to full weight bearing (FWB) 4-6 weeks post-op per surgeon.  Begin weaning from boot at 
post-op week 6. 
• If SPR is REPAIRED, continue with partial progressive weight bearing with crutches until 
post-op week 6 then progress to FWB.  Wean from boot at post-op week 8. 
 
 
Additional 
Intervention 
*Continue with 
Phase I-II 
Interventions as 
indicated. 
Range of motion/Mobility 
• Foot and ankle joint mobilizations may be performed if indicated during this time per therapist 
discretion provided they do not stress the repair. 
• If SPR in NOT REPAIRED, continue with foot and ankle mobility exercises from previous phase. 
• If SPR is REPAIRED, in addition to dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, may begin inversion and 
eversion as well after post-op week 6.
