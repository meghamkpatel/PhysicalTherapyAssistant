 
 
Rehabilitation Protocol for Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty 
 
This protocol is intended to guide clinicians and patients through the post-operative course after a reverse shoulder 
arthroplasty. Specific interventions should be based on the needs of the individual and should consider exam findings 
and clinical decision making. If you have questions, contact the referring physician.  
 
There are a few significant differences in post-operative guidelines between a total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and 
reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) primarily due to rotator cuff arthropathy. Deltoid function and periscapular strength 
become primary sources of shoulder mobility and stability. 
 
Considerations for the Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty Rehabilitation Program 
Many different factors influence the post-operative reverse shoulder arthroplasty rehabilitation outcome, including 
surgical approach, concomitant repair of the rotator cuff, arthroplasty secondary to fracture, arthroplasty secondary to 
rheumatoid arthritis or osteonecrosis, revision arthroplasty, and individual patient factors including co-morbidities. It is 
recommended that patients meet all rehabilitation criteria in order to progress to the next phase and clinicians 
collaborate closely with the referring physician throughout the rehabilitation process.  
 
Post-operative Complications 
If you develop a fever, unresolving numbness/tingling, excessive drainage from the incision, uncontrolled pain, 
unresolving tenderness over the acromion or any other symptoms you have concerns about you should contact the 
referring physician.
